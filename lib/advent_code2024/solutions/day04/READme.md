# Coding Challenge: Ceres Search

## Problem Summary

You are presented with a word search puzzle where you must find all occurrences of
the word "XMAS". The word can appear in various directions and orientations, including:

- Horizontal (left-to-right and right-to-left)
- Vertical (top-to-bottom and bottom-to-top)
- Diagonal (both directions)
- Overlapping with other words

## Example Puzzle

Below is a simplified word search grid where irrelevant characters are replaced
with `.`:

```txt
..X...
.SAMX.
.A..A.
XMAS.S
.X....
```

In this grid, "XMAS" can appear in multiple ways.

## Larger Example

For the following complete grid:

```txt
MMMSXXMASM
MSAMXMSMSA
AMXSXMAAMM
MSAMASMSMX
XMASAMXAMM
XXAMMXXAMA
SMSMSASXSS
SAXAMASAAA
MAMMMXMMMM
MXMXAXMASX
```

The word "XMAS" occurs **18 times**. Visualizing the grid with only the letters
in "XMAS" highlighted:

```txt
....XXMAS.
.SAMXMS...
...S..A...
..A.A.MS.X
XMASAMX.MM
X.....XA.A
S.S.S.S.SS
.A.A.A.A.A
..M.M.M.MM
.X.X.XMASX
```

## Objective

For the given puzzle input, calculate and return the total number of times the word
"XMAS" appears in all possible orientations.

## Notes

- Words can overlap and share characters.
- Input will be a rectangular grid of letters.

Good luck helping the little Elf! ðŸŒŸ
